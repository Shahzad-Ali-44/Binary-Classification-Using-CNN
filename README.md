# Binary Classification Using CNN


## Project Overview
This project aims to classify images into two categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained on a dataset of images, which enables it to make predictions on new, unseen data.


## Model Architecture
The CNN model is built with the following architecture:
- Convolutional Layers
- Pooling Layers
- Dense Layers
